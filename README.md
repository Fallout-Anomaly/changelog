# **Fallout Anomaly – Final Pre-Release Changelog**

**Note:** This update is **not save-safe**. A new game is required.

---

## Core System Changes

- **Commonwealth Mine mod** removed due to inconsistent placement and mines spawning beneath the player.  
- **Gasmask overlay system** disabled — incomplete and non-functional.  
- **Global Stash** system removed to preserve balance and prevent unintended item access.  
- **SKK Fast Start** replaced with a new, flexible **Alternate Start** framework.  
- **Legendary chip spawn rates** increased to improve progression pacing.  
- **Agony** and legacy first-aid mods removed for full integration of **MAIM** and **True Damage** (patching in progress).  
- **Complex Sorter** and **Facegen** fully rebuilt to reflect structural changes.  
- **Tyrants** temporarily removed for balance testing. They will return in a future patch after tuning.  
- **Immersive Hunting Overhaul (IHO)** has been replaced with **Hunter of the Commonwealth**. IHO is outdated, script-heavy, and no longer compatible with our future versions.
- **Vault sink** now provides fresh water. This is under review based on balance feedback.  
- **Pip-Boy mod** updated to resolve visual issues in the Vault.  
- **Fake See-Through Scopes** mod removed — only used by one weapon.  
- **Machineguns Craftable plugin** removed due to incorrect compaction by the author.    
- **Anomaly Guide Notes & MCM Config** removed for time being while we rewrite and expand.
